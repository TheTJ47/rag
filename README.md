# Unified Multimodal RAG System

This project is a **high-performance, offline-first multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system**.  
It features a sleek, Apple-inspired user interface with both light and dark modes, allowing users to ingest various file types (documents, images, audio) and query them using a powerful language model.

The system is designed for **demonstration**, showcasing:
- A live connection to the **Google Gemini API** for real-time analysis.
- High-accuracy simulation with detailed source attribution.
- A professional proof-of-concept UI/UX.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multimodal Ingestion**: Process `.pdf`, `.doc`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.mp3`, and `.wav` files.  
- **Live AI-Powered Q&A**: Utilizes the **Google Gemini API** for intelligent, context-aware responses.  
- **High-Accuracy Simulation**: Backend generates performance scores consistently above 80% to simulate a tuned RAG pipeline.  
- **Detailed Source Attribution**: Each response includes mock sources with unique `chunkIds`, page numbers, timestamps, or confidence scores.  
- **Professional UI/UX**: Clean, modern interface inspired by Apple‚Äôs design language, with light/dark mode toggle.  
- **Offline First**: Self-contained architecture, ideal for private or disconnected environments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) **v18.x or later**  
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

## üöÄ How to Run This Project

### 1. Set Up the Project
Place all project files (`index.html`, `server.js`, `package.json`, `README.md`) in a single directory.

### 2. Install Dependencies
In your terminal:

```bash
npm install
````

This will create a `node_modules` folder in your project directory.

### 3. Add Your API Key (Crucial Step)

Open `server.js` in a code editor.
Find this line (around line 125):

```js
const apiKey = ""; // Environment provides this
```

Replace it with your **Google AI Studio API key**:

```js
const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"; // Environment provides this
```

Save the file.

### 4. Run the Backend Server

Start the server with:

```bash
npm start
```

If successful, you‚Äôll see:

```
Server is running on http://localhost:3000
```

### 5. Open the Frontend UI

Open `index.html` in your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
You can now ingest a file and start asking questions.

## üìå Notes

* This project is for **demonstration purposes** only.
* Actual AI responses are simulated with performance metrics to showcase the concept.
